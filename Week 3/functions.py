### Exercise question
def find_num(number_list: list, number: int)->bool:
  for iterate_number in number_list:
    if iterate_number == number:
      return True
    else:
      pass
result = find_num([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], 9)
print(result)


### Exercise question 2, check if there is an even number in a list of numbers, return true if found, else return false
##Logic: Two loops are used. First loop takes values from user and stores in a list. Second loop checks each element in list for an even number. I have used .pop() method to take out each element from list.
list1 = []
print("Enter 5 numbers")

def even():                     #function definition
  for i in range(5):            #first for loop to get numbers and store in list1 
    list1.append(input())       
  for i in range(5):            #second loop to pop out items from list and check if it is even
    num = int(list1.pop())
    if (num %2 == 0):          #check if number is even
      return 1                 #if even found, return 0 and break from the second loop
      break
    else:                      
      pass                     #do nothing, keep going
  return 0                     #if even number not found, return 0 to the called function even()

print("Return:",even())


##Exercise question 3, Lambda fucntion to calculate volume of a cylinder
#cylider-volume=3.14*r*r*height
print("What is the radius of cylinder in cm?")
r=float(input())
print("What is the height of cylinder in cm?")
height=float(input())
volume = lambda r : 3.14*r*r*height

print("Volume of cylinder:{:.2f} cmÂ³".format(volume(r)))
